This is my own Discord bot. I use it for some various unusual commands.
I plan to implement a music feature, as well as a TTS-Engine.
I used [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to create the bot.

## How to use

Currently this bot is not available for public use.
I plan to host it on a server running 24/7 and make it public, but that will take a while.

## Features
- ```-ping```
    - Sends the current response time in ms.
- ```-move [@Users] Channel```
    - Moves all mentioned users to the specified channel.
- ```-move_all Channel1 Channel2```
    - Moves all users in a channel to another channel.
- ```-shame_on_you @User```
    - Moves the mentioned user out of the channel for five seconds so he can contemplate his life choices.
- ```-say_sike```
    - Send a picture of a specific piranha plant.
